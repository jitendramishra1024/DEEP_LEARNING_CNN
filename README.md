# DEEP_LEARNING_CNN
This repository contains code for  CNN projects for Image classification 

01.CAT_DOG_CLASSIFIER 


We are going  to test an provided image is dog or cat 

i.e binary classification using Convolution neural network

dataset description  :
training_set: 4000 cat image 4000 dog image 
test_set: 1000 cat image 1000 dog image 
single_prediction :2 images cat_or_dog 

STEPS :

    1.upload dataset.zip to google drive Colab Notebooks 

    2.Upload code 

    3. run CAT_DOG_CLASSIFIER.ipynb 

Features :
Added drop out layer , added data augmentation to reduce overfitting
Final model saved into h5 file and model prediction done from h5 file 
plotted graph to show training and test accuracy over epochs
